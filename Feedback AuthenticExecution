Feedback AuthenticExecution

- It was confusing for me that 'make event_manager_trustzone ' had to be executed from the 'env' directory while the build phase finished in the 'build' directory of the 'optee' directory which is initialised as optee_os.git.
- When the event manager has been started it is not entirely clear how to interact with it.
- When deploying the reactive tool using REACTIVE-TOOLS the description file cannot be found, I assume it has to do with the way I describe the path but after trying countless possibilities I don't know what to try anymore.
