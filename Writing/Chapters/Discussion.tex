\begin{itemize}
\item Solution overview \begin{itemize}
\item Reproduction
\item Thorough understanding paper solution
\item Extensions
\end{itemize}
\item Shortcomings \begin{itemize}
\item Unaccounted for attacker possibilities
\item Unaccomplished desired guarantees
\end{itemize}
\item Positives \begin{itemize}
\item Open source code
\item Thorough comparison
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Currently only the code in the textsection is being attested which is far from enough to trust the execution of a device.
\medskip

The datastructures of the applications running in the NW or the OS should also be taken into account.
\medskip

The state of the memory could be restricted to always comply with certain invariants that can be checked.
\medskip

Check whether the method applied is sufficient to protect against the attacker model and if not explain why.
