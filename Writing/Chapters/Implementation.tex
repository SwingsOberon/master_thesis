\section{Attestation TA}

\begin{itemize}
\item Trusted Application \begin{itemize}
\item Hash NW memory pages
\item Store reference values in secure memory
\item Make comparison and notify user 
\end{itemize}
\item NW OS interaction \begin{itemize}
\item Retrieve address of memory page
\item Translate into physical address
\item Provide datastructures to TA
\end{itemize}
\item Extensions \begin{itemize}
\item Notify user using trusted IO
\item Decrease dependency on NW OS
\item Attest more than just code pages (data structures, invariants,...)
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

The attestation is mainly implemented in a Trusted Application. This is done to allow the Secure World to store measurements in the secure memory and have access to the Normal World memory. Ideally the TA doesn't need to rely on the NW OS (Linux) for the memory addresses but this is the starting point for the implementation.
