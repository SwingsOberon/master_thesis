\chapter{Method}

The main goal of this work is to achieve a secure open platform on the hardware.

\section{System Model}

The system model describes an open platform with no or minimal trust among stakeholders.

\section{Attacker Model}

The attacker has physical access, can launch OS/firmware and software attacks. The Trusted Platform Module is assumed to be tamper resistent.

\section{Solution}

Ideally the device is started with secure boot, this makes sure the SW is started from a known secure state. 
\medskip

During operation the user should be able to attest whether their device is still in a secure state.
\medskip

This can be done using a TA that makes measurements on their device and reports back to them.
\medskip

These measurements are checking the integrity of the code section of the running applications and OS.
