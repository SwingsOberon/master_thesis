\chapter{Background}

The smartphone that will be used is a PinePhone which is equiped with ARM TrustZone, it also comes with a component which can be used as Root of Trust to make secure boot possible. 

\section{PinePhone}

The PinePhone is an open source smartphone which supports Linux as operating system which adds to it's openness.

\section{Trusted Execution Environment}

A Trusted Execution Environment is a secure, integrity-protected processing environment, consisting of memory and storage capabilities.

\section{ARM TrustZone}

ARM TrustZone is ARM's implementation of a TEE. This is achieved by having a secure and normal world in the System on Chip.

\section{Chain of Trust}

To trust an application, the environment in which this application runs also needs to be trusted which often translates to the operating system, bootloader, hardware,...

\section{Secure Boot}

Secure boot is a booting process in which a Root of Trust is used to make sure that the code used for booting is not tampered with.

\section{Remote Attestation}

Remote attestation allows a device to prove to an external verifier that the software running on it is not tampered with. This attestation can go a lot further than this by for instance also checking the data structures on the device to make sure these are logical.
