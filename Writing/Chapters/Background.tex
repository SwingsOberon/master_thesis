\chapter{Background}

The smartphone that will be used is a PinePhone which is equiped with ARM TrustZone, it also comes with a component which can be used as Root of Trust to make secure boot possible. 

\section{Remote Attestation}

\begin{itemize}
\item Goal \begin{itemize}
\item Verify integrity
\end{itemize}
\item How it works \begin{itemize}
\item Verifier
\item Prover
\item Proof
\end{itemize}
\item Assumptions \begin{itemize}
\item Trusted third party
\item Secure keys
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Remote attestation allows a device to prove to an external verifier that the software running on it is not tampered with. This attestation can go a lot further than this by for instance also checking the data structures on the device to make sure these are logical.

\section{Trusted Execution Environment}

\begin{itemize}
\item Execution \begin{itemize}
\item Isolation
\item Authentic code
\item Runtime integrity
\item Strict interfaces
\end{itemize} 
\item Trust \begin{itemize}
\item Static
\item Dynamic
\end{itemize}
\item Security \begin{itemize}
\item Data separation
\item Sanitization
\item Control of information flow
\item Fault isolation
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

A Trusted Execution Environment is a secure, integrity-protected processing environment, consisting of memory and storage capabilities.

\section{ARM TrustZone}

\begin{itemize}
\item Normal World \begin{itemize}
\item Rich OS
\end{itemize}
\item Secure World \begin{itemize}
\item Trusted Kernel
\item NS-bit
\item Secure Configuration Register
\end{itemize}
\item Peripherals \begin{itemize}
\item TZ Address Space Controller
\item TZ Protection Controller (interrupts)
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

ARM TrustZone is ARM's implementation of a TEE. This is achieved by having a secure and normal world in the System on Chip.

\section{PinePhone}

\begin{itemize}
\item Open source \begin{itemize}
\item
\end{itemize}
\item Linux \begin{itemize}
\item
\end{itemize}
\item ARM TrustZone \begin{itemize}
\item
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

The PinePhone is an open source smartphone which supports Linux as operating system which adds to it's openness.

\section{Secure boot, trusted boot and remote attestation for ARM TrustZone-based IoT Nodes}

\begin{itemize}
\item Solution \begin{itemize}
\item Overview
\end{itemize}
\item Trusted Boot \begin{itemize}
\item Trusted load phase
\item Attestation during boot
\end{itemize}
\item Remote attestation \begin{itemize}
\item Trusted execution time
\item Pagebased approach
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
